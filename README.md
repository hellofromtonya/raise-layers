# Raise Layers Configuration

I use the [Dygma Raise keybard](https://dygma.com/). It's truly elevated my productivity due to its configuration layers and the [awesome thumb keys](https://youtu.be/J7JVvFa330g).

This repo shares my layers configuration. 

Feel free to use it as your starting point in your journey to optimize your workflow.
